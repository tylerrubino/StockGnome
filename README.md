## üßæ Notes

- Be sure to create a `.env` file in both `/backend` and `/frontend` if needed.
- `.env` is needed in the `backend\` folder, add the following in it:
  - SECRET_KEY=some_secret_key -> make one here: https://djecrety.ir/

- The virtual environment folder (`env/`) and `node_modules/` are ignored via `.gitignore`.

## üöß Working on Tasks & Issues

We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/your-org/projectname/projects) to manage tasks across the team.

### üß† Task Workflow

1. **Pick a task from the `To do` column** in the [ProjectName GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/tylerrubino/projects/1).
2. **Assign yourself** to the task.
3. **Move the task to `In progress`** to indicate you're working on it.
4. **Create a new branch** using the correct naming convention:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b projectname-<issueNumber>-<task-name>
   # Example:
   git checkout -b projectname-12-add-new-api
   ```

5. Make your changes, commit, and push to your branch:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new API endpoint"
   git push -u origin projectname-12-add-new-api
   ```

6. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to `main`, referencing the issue:

   - Name the PR `projectname#12 - add new api`
   - Add `Closes #12` at the bottom of your description to auto-link and close the issue on merge.

7. After opening your PR:

   - **Move the task to `Code review`**
   - **Unassign yourself** to indicate it‚Äôs ready for peer review

8. In the issues comment section add a comment with some test instructions for the code reviewer to test with and gain context.
